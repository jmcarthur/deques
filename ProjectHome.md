The goal of this project is to produce and verify purely functional deque implementations offering at least:

  * `push`: add an element to the front of a deque
  * `pop`: remove an element from the front of a deque
  * `inject`: add an element to the back of a deque
  * `eject`: remove an element from the back of a deque
