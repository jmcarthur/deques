{- 
This is an implementation of worst-case constant-time deques. 
It is modified from the course notes of Robert Tarjan and Radu Mihaescu:

http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall03/cs528/handouts/Notes%20on%20Catenable%20Deques.doc

This deque can also support O(lg(min(n-i,i))) indexing.
With an accumulation measure like Hinze & Paterson's finger trees, indexing can be on quantities other than position.
